# 1. Power Consumption Pricing
# a) X would be the power used on a said day in a month in a year for many years. 

# b) Y would be the price of electric per kwh on that day

# c) Using previous discrete points several years in the past, 
# you can train the model to predict power consumption in the future.

# d) Choosing the level of regression (linear, polynomial, logarithmic) is a challenging part
# because you want it to fit to the curve as best as possible especially for power consumption.
# This typically decides what the power company will charge you for electric in the future.

# 2. Identifying different types of cars in photos
# a) X would be the photos of certain types of cars in them

# b) Y would be a string of what brand car is in the photo

# c) I would take photos from the internet of the cars on the road and then create the output 
# by looking at the photos and writing down which brand it is (Toyota, Honda, Mercedes, BMW)

# d) Since there is a lot of variation within car brands, I would need an emormous dataset.

# 3) Basic Operations
